http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/

2) News Articles on Twenty topics: 20-label news dataset
https://scikit-learn.org/0.19/datasets/twenty_newsgroups.html


## Files
1) Project2.ipynb: Script for traininig and predicting on datasets using Naive Bayes and logistic regression

2) Movie Set Review - Get CSV.ipynb: simple script to export the Movie Reviews dataset to a CSV. This was run on a local runtime rather than on Google Colab, as loading data from Google Drive is quite slow.
